# intro to tutorials

This directory serves to show the basic functionality of the boxes package.

We touch upon network generation, boxing (with builtin and possible external) wrapper, IO and an external db fitting code.

(Note that external parts have not been exposed to extensive testing for possible bugs. Also behold issues.)

The directory structure I used on my device when running the notebooks:

__package:__ \t  \~/code/new_structure/boxes

__tutorial notebooks:__ \t  \~/code/new_structure/
                        
__results:__ \t  /result_logs   \~/facebook_caltech_demo/ .... etc
