# boxes
This module contains several box-covering algorithms, which are designed to estimate the fractal dimensionn of complex networks. 
The following algorithms are implemented:
* Random sequental (RS)
* Compact-Box-Burning (CBB)
* Max-Excluded Mass Burning(MEMB) 
* 


This module was developed by Marcell Nagy and Péter Kovács at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Department of Stochastics. We are grateful for the contributions of Botond Diviki-Nagy.



Fork if you feel like.

Some basic tutorial provided but recommend to read the docs & the report first.

Obviously, you may want to run the [tutorial notebook](./tutorial/boxing_tutorial.ipynb) to understand how the __boxes__ package works.
