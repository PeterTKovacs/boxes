# boxes
This module contains several box-covering algorithms, which are designed to estimate the fractal dimensionn of complex networks. 
The following algorithms are implemented:
* Random sequental (RS)
* Greedy coloring (GC)
* Compact-Box-Burning (CBB)
* Max-Excluded Mass Burning(MEMB) 
* Ratio of excluded mass to closeness centrality (REMCC)
* MCWR algortihm
* Merge algorithm (MA)
* Simulated annealing algorithm (SA)
* Overlapping Box Covering Algorithm (OBCA)
* Differential evolution (DE)
* Fuzzy box-covering
* Particle Swarm Optimization Box-covering Algorithm (PSO)


This module was developed by Marcell Nagy and Péter Kovács at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Department of Stochastics. We are grateful for the contributions of Botond Diviki-Nagy.



Fork if you feel like.

Some basic tutorial provided but recommend to read the docs & the report first.

Obviously, you may want to run the [tutorial notebook](./tutorial/boxing_tutorial.ipynb) in the tutorial folder to be able to load the __boxes__ package.
